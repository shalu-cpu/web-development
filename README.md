# Gas Tracker App

## Project Title
Gas Tracker: A Decentralized Gas Price Tracking System on Stellar

## Project Description
Gas Tracker is a blockchain-based application built on the Stellar network using Soroban smart contracts. It enables real-time tracking and verification of gas prices across different locations. The system allows trusted providers to submit gas price data, which is then securely stored on the blockchain and made available to users, helping them find the best gas prices in their vicinity.

## Project Vision
In a world where fuel costs significantly impact both individuals and businesses, transparency and accessibility to accurate gas price information is crucial. Gas Tracker aims to revolutionize how people interact with gas price data by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure data integrity, transparency, and accessibility.

Our vision is to create a decentralized ecosystem where:
1. Users can access reliable, up-to-date gas price information
2. Trusted providers can contribute verified price data
3. The entire system operates with minimal overhead and maximum efficiency
4. Information asymmetry in the fuel market is reduced, benefiting consumers
